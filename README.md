This app allows you to generate camera drone shoot ideas based on location and radius selected. It uses the overpass api to select the locations.

How to use: Select a location on the map and a radius using the slider and just press generate. In a couple of seconds, names of the recommendations will appear to the right of the map.

The searching isn`t fully optimized yet, i will try to fix it to give better and more relevant places ASAP.
